INSTRUCTIONS:

Provide solutions to the tests within the folder '/tests'.

You are only permitted to edit the contents of javascript files within the '/tests' folder.
Editing any other file will not be considered a correct solution.

You are allowed to use whatever online resources you need to develop your solutions.

If you are stumped, you are allowed to ask for hints.

NOTE:

If you are unable to edit the code directly, you'll need to click the fork button in the top right to make changes to this codebase. You may need a github account for that.
